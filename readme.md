# Universal-platform
Welcome to the Nexus Universal Platform, a comprehensive ecosystem that encompasses a diverse range of content, a defined set of guidelines, and an array of tools. This platform is designed to accommodate your apps, games, and more, with the goal of standardizing and unifying all aspects of development.

For instance, developers can leverage tools and languages such as Flutter, Dart, and Swift, among others. While React Native is not explicitly listed, its use is not prohibited. However, it's important to note that certain technologies, such as those specific to Apple, may not be supported. On the other hand, systems like Linux, Windows, Android, Nexus OS, and more, are compatible with our platform.
